<h2> DATA </h2>
<h3>[This github repository](https://github.com/bnetobradley/metamorphylo) contains the raw data and code for analyses used in *B.M. Neto-Bradley*'s MSc. Thesis.</h3>

<h4> In the __/data__ folder of this repository, there are 3 sets of raw data files, corresponding to measurements taken for 138 individuals growing at the _UBC_ and _Van Dusen Botanical Gardens_. All of these data have been measured on the same set of leaves, between May and September of 2019.</h4>
<h3>1. __Rapid A/Ci Response (RACiR) data__</h3>

<h5> __Files:__ 
Find these under __/data/licor_data/txt/__ files are named in the following format  __yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm_genus_species__ </h5>

<h5> __Blurb:__  RACiR curves (as described in *Stinziano et al. 2017*) characterize the change in Net photosynthesis __A__ relative to changes in CO2. Functionally this describes the physiological constraints of how quickly and efficiently a plant can take up CO2. During our RACiR curve measurements, CO2 is ramped from 10 ppm to 1010 ppm at a rate of + 100 ppm per minute. While this is ongoing, CO2 accumulates in the chamber such that the true CO2 contents of the chamber are slightly out of sync with the concentration of CO2 measured by the machine. In order to correct for this lag, two curves are measured - a data curve and an empty curve for callibrating the data curve. </h5>

<h5> __Data Specifics:__ 
The RACiR data is comprised of 2 data files: an "empty curve" and a "data curve" (see above.) The empty curve characterizes how CO2 accumulates in an empty chamber throughout the course of the A/Ci measurement, and the data curve characterizes a leaf's photosynthetic rates change in response to increasing CO2. Empty curves were collected every hour to two hours - for every empty curve multiple that were collected in close temporal proximity can be corrected (for the lag in CO2 measured - as described above.) Every measurement has its own txt file that was generated by the LiCor6800 machine when the measurement was finalized. </h5>

<h5> __Time & Place:__
RACiR curves were measured on the youngest fully expanded leaves of each of the 138 species studied here. These measurements were taken between May 5th and July 18th 2019 at the UBC and VanDusen Botanical Garden. </h5>

<h3>2. __Morphological measurements__ </h3>

<h5> __Files:__ 
Find these under __/data/netobradley_garden_data.csv__ </h5>

<h5> __Blurb:__ 
After each RACiR curve was measured, the leaf (or several leaves in the case of small leaves/needles) on which this was taken were harvested measured for leaf thickness (at three points across the leaf - while avoiding the midrib) and put in a sealed bag, which was stored in a cooler overnight. The next morning, the leaves were measured for fresh mass and leaf area. The leaves were then dried for 48 hours in an oven at 60 degrees Celsius. After this the leaves were weighed for dry mass.</h5>

<h5> __Time & Place:__ 
These measurements were taken the day of, or the following day at the Beaty Biodiversity Research Centre at the UBC Vancouver Campus. </h5>

<h3>3. __Chemical analyses for Nitrogen and Carbon of leaves__ </h3>

<h5> __Files:__ 
Find these under __/data/netobradley_msc_leaf_chemistry.csv__ </h5>

<h5> __Blurb:__ 
Once the leaf tissues were dried, these were sent off for chemical analysis for the Nitrogen and Carbon contents by combustion.
</h5>

<h5> __Time & Place:__ 
These measurements were done at bla bla labs in bla bla, during September 2019. </h5>

<h2> CODE </h2>
<h4> In the __/R__ folder of this repository, there are multiple sections of code required in the mental gymnastics that are cleaning and manipulating these datasets. Below is a roadmap to these gymnastics. </h4>

<h3>1. __Cleaning: read the RACiR data__ </h3>
<h3>2. __Cleaning: correct the RACiR data by leaf area in chamber__</h3>
<h3>3. __Cleaning: correct the RACiR data by CO2 lag empty/data__ </h3>
<h3>4. __Cleaning: fit Parameters to the clean and corrected RACiR data__ </h3>
<h3>5. __Analysis: divergence__ </h3>
<h3>6. __Analysis: PICs__ </h3>
<h3>7. __Analysis: PGLS__ </h3>
